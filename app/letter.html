				<p>re: parking charge appeal – reference 9834234</p>
				<p>
					Dear ParkingEye,<br>
					I am writing this letter to appeal a ticket that was given to my vehicle (license plate HGH6 67FG) on Tuesday 1st May 2018 (ticket reference number 9834234) at Hapsted.The car parking signage was not prominent, so I did not know I was entering into a controlled parking zone, nor any sort of contract upon entering the car park. Specifically, there was no sign at the entrance of the car park. there were no visible signs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The term imposing the parking charge therefore fails the transparency requirement of s68 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, and so is unfair and not binding on me by virtue of s62(1).I have attached evidence that the signs were not prominent, nor visible, at the time of entry to the car park.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
					Furthermore, please provide me of evidence that you are the landowner; failing that please identify the landowner and provide a copy of your authority to issue the ticket on their behalf.<br>
					For the reasons above the parking charge should be cancelled.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yours sincerely,<br>
